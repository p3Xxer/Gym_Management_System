# Gym Management System
The project manages the functioning of a gym or workout and exercise facility. The information included in this project consists of the profiling of members, the list of available services, payment transactions consisting of the membership fees and other additional features, and a list of the available trainers that will guide the users in their workout. The members can avail a service based on their needs from the list of available services. The instructor/gym trainer will be assigned to customers based on their requirements and charged extra accordingly. The gym will also have a manager to manage the overall functioning of the gym.
